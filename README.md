## Socializing in a pandemic is tough, but finding community is even harder. Our app lets students meet others and study through an online chat and planning forum for specific subjects/courses.

### Description 
Our app allows users to login or signup to see all study groups available... Additionally, they can enter a room and see all the users in this study group and chat with them as well. A user can also navigate to their profile page to see what study groups they're in. Our front end is built with ReactJS and our backend is built with Node and Express.

### Quick Start/Installation
